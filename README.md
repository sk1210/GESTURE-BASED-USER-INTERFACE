# GESTURE-BASED-USER-INTERFACE
Here I designed a complete graphical interface , in which there are many application , the whole interface is controlled by the gesture of hands .

#Language and Dependency

  API - 
    Pygame  - API for making games .
    OpenCV  - A Computer vision Library .
    
  Components :
      Graphical interface is designed using Pygame ( a library for making games )
      Rest of Gesture recognition is done with the help of OpenCV


#Applications  :

   Image Viewer : Any Image can be viewd by touching the thumb and fingers ,Next and Previous image can be viewed by forward and backward                    motion of fingers over the image .

    Car racing game : The motion of car is controlled by the motion of fingers .

    Virtual Keyboard : A complete keyboard made using pygame , Virtually user can type anything .
